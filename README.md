# FOP-project 

*Simple interpreter for __{a programming language}__.*

###### The project will focus on creating and supporting a minimal subset of the language,with an emphasis on basic constructs like variables, arithmetic, conditionals, and iterative control flow. The interpreter will be capable of executing simple algorithms, serving as a proof of its functionality.
