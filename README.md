# FOP-project 

*Simple interpreter for __GoLang__.*

###### The project focuses on creating and supporting a minimal subset of the language, with an emphasis on basic constructs such as variables, arithmetic operations, conditionals, and iterative control flow. The interpreter is capable of executing simple algorithms, serving as proof of its functionality.You can find the code in the [goCode](goCode) folder, which can be executed using the [Main.java](src/Main.java) file. Simply run [Main.java](src/Main.java) and provide the name of the file you want to execute. You are, of course, welcome to add your own code to the project.
